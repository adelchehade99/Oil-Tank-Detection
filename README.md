# Oil Tank Detection

This repository contains the code and configurations for advanced oil tank detection using state-of-the-art YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models. The project leverages the most extensive and meticulously curated dataset in the domain, facilitating comprehensive model training and deployment.

## Repository Structure

- **`Annotation Format Conversion to YOLO/`**: Scripts for converting public dataset annotations to the YOLO format.
- **`training/`**: Scripts and configurations for training YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 variants.
- **`deployment/`**: Scripts for deploying trained models on images and videos.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the [releases section](https://github.com/adelchehade99/Oil-Tank-Detection/releases). You can download it directly from the [latest release](https://github.com/adelchehade99/Oil-Tank-Detection/releases/latest).

## Installation
